Here are tables for rcBK with kinematic constraint as in PLB 803 (2020). Please note that I've not tested the code with the Balitsky rc scheme (I tested it against Bertrand's tables for the minimal dipole rc scheme). But I'm confident it works, since it is just a change in the BK kernel. Btw, I can also provide tables for the kinematically constrained BK used in PRD 102, 074028 (2020) if you wish (this time I will be faster^^).
